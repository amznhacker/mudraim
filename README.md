# 🎯 Mudra Air Typing

**Draw letters in the air with mouse gestures!**

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**1. Assign this key in your Mudra app:**
- Twist → **F1**

**2. Run the system:**
```bash
python3 mudra.py
```

## ✍️ How It Works

**Mouse Mode:** Normal mouse gestures (pinch, scroll, etc.)

**Air Typing Mode:** Draw letter shapes in the air with mouse movement!

### Simple Letter Patterns
- **→** (right) → 'i'
- **←** (left) → 'l'  
- **↑** (up) → 't'
- **↓** (down) → 'j'

### Common Letters
- **→←** (back/forth) → 'e' (most common)
- **↑↓** (up/down) → 'a'
- **↓↑** (down/up) → 'o'
- **←→** (left/right) → 's'

### Letter Shapes
- **→↓** (L shape) → 'r'
- **↑→** (reverse L) → 'p'
- **→↓←** (C shape) → 'c'
- **←↓→** (U shape) → 'u'

## ⚡ Why This Is Better

**Traditional typing:** Memorize complex chord combinations
**Air typing:** Draw letters naturally like handwriting in the air

**Result:** Intuitive and fast once you learn the patterns!

## 🎯 Workflow

1. **Browse** with normal mouse gestures
2. **F1 (twist)** → enter air typing mode  
3. **Draw letters** in the air with mouse movement
4. **Left click** → space between words
5. **Right click** → finish current letter
6. **F1 again** → back to mouse
