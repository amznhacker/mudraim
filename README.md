# 🎯 Mudra Gesture Pad

**Dedicated gesture area - doesn't interfere with mouse!**

## 🎨 Smart Design

**Problem solved:** Drawing gestures anywhere would interfere with normal mouse use
**Solution:** Small floating gesture pad window - draw only in the dedicated area!

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**1. Assign in Mudra app:**
- Twist → **F1**

**2. Run:**
```bash
python3 mudra.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

**Floating window:** Small 200x200 pixel gesture area
**Always on top:** Easy access while working
**Visual feedback:** Red lines show your gestures
**Mode indicator:** White = mouse mode, Yellow = typing mode

## ✍️ Gesture System

**Single gestures:**
- **→** e (most common)
- **←** t  
- **↑** a
- **↓** o
- **↗** i
- **↘** n
- **↖** s
- **↙** h

**Double gestures (same direction twice):**
- **→→** r
- **←←** d  
- **↑↑** l
- **↓↓** c

## 🎯 Usage

1. **F1** → Toggle typing mode (window turns yellow)
2. **Draw gestures** only in the white/yellow area
3. **See red lines** as you draw
4. **Letters appear** where your cursor is
5. **F1 again** → Back to mouse mode (window turns white)

## ⚡ Benefits

**No interference:** Normal mouse use everywhere except the small pad
**Visual feedback:** See exactly what gestures you're making
**Always accessible:** Floating window stays on top
**Dedicated space:** Clear boundary between mouse and typing

**Example:** "the" = **←** **↙** **→** (t-h-e) drawn in the pad
